# mjml-starRating-component

A boilerplate to quickly get started when creating your own component.

* Clone the repo
* `npm install` inside
* Add your component inside `components` folder
* Add your component route to `.mjmlconfig` (make sure to link the one in the /lib folder)
* Use your own component in `index.mjml` (or uncomment the `mj-star` if you want to test the one already created)
* `npm run build` to build, or `npm start` if you want to watch recompile on each file change
* Result will be in `index.html`
